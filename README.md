This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is part of the react workshop, where we create a basic 
react application

- Clone the application
- cd into cloned directory 
- Run ``` npm i ```
- Run ``` npm start ```
- Application will be served on localhost:3000
